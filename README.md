 here is an overview about virtual friend :-

A virtual friend is a computer program that can simulate conversation with a human user. Virtual friends are often used as a form of entertainment or companionship, but they can also be used for educational or therapeutic purposes.

Virtual friends can be used to ask any query, just like Echo or Google Assistant. They can access and process information from the real world through Google Search and keep their response consistent with search results. They can also learn and adapt to the user's preferences over time, making them more personalized and engaging.
